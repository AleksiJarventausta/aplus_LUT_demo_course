description: Append text from EditText to TextView
instructions: |
    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
      Create a user interface that has one button and one paragraph. 
      The button should have id "btnSubmit", and the paragraph should have id "txtResult". 
      Pressing the button should change the text in paragraph so that it has "Hello World!" text.
    </p>

    <h4>Upload APK file</h4>
    <p>
        You can generate the APK file from Android Studio by using the <b>Build APK</b> option, 
        which produces a debug APK file. The name that you choose for the uploaded file is 
        irrelevant and does not affect the automated grading.
